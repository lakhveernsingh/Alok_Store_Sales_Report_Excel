#1 Data Cleaning-
	
 	--- Looked for any null, or duplicate values that may have crept into the raw data and did minor correction to details to vague details 
      like, there were 4 categories (Men, M, Women, W) in the gender column so consolidated it into 2 genders.

#2 Data Processing-
  
	--- To make the data more easy to analyse i created an age bracket which created three categories of different age group. Also extraced 
      month from the date column to filter all the months.

#3 Analysis-
  
	--- Created pivot tables for easy analysis for each problem.
  
	--- Created pivot charts and a dashboard for easy understanding.
  
	--- Inserted slicers for dynamic presentation of data.
